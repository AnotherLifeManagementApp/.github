AnotherLifeManagementApp (ALMA) is a small attempt at fixing our lifes since we moved into our own personal flat for the first time in our life.
Since we can not be bothered to remember everything or pay like 50000000€ a day for all needed subscriptions we rather spend way too long building our own stuff.

Planned use of the following Technologies:
Angular: Frontend
Python/Flask: Backend/Api
Postgres SQL: Database
Management: Docker
